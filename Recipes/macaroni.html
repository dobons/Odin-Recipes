    <h1>Macaroni</h1>
    <img src="../Images/macaroni.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Macaroni is dry pasta shaped like narrow tubes. Made with durum wheat, macaroni is commonly cut in short lengths; curved macaroni may be referred to as elbow macaroni. Some home machines can make macaroni shapes but, like most pasta, macaroni is usually made commercially by large-scale extrusion. The curved shape is created by different speeds of extrusion on opposite sides of the pasta tube as it comes out of the machine. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups dried elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped green pepper or frozen peas </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter </li>
        <li>⅓ cup finely chopped onion </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt or to taste </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook macaroni according to package directions, adding green pepper or peas during the last 3 minutes of cooking; drain. Cover and keep warm.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, for sauce, melt butter over medium heat in a large skillet. Cook onion in hot butter for 4 to 5 minutes or until onion is tender. Stir in flour, salt, and black pepper. Add milk all at once. Whisk constantly until thick and bubbly. Cook, whisking constantly, for 2 more minutes. Reduce heat to low.
        </li>
        <li>Add American & cheddar cheese blend and mozzarella cheese, stirring until sauce is smooth and cheese is melted. Stir the sauce and bison pepperoni into the pasta. Heat through.
