    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../Images/lasagna.jpg" alt="Lasagna">    
    <p>Lasagne are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,[2] made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as rag√π (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil.[3] The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically, cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting casserole is cut into single-serving square portions. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large spaghetti squash, halved and seeded </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed </li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion </li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li>1 pound bulk pork sausage </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce </li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Place each squash half cut-side down on the prepared baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until easily pierced with a knife, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven and cool until easily handled. Scrape insides of squash into spaghetti strands with a fork. Transfer to a colander and place over a bowl to drain.
        </li>
        <li>While squash is baking, heat olive oil in skillet over medium heat; stir in onion and garlic. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add sausage, breaking it up with a sturdy spoon to remove clumps. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Stir Worcestershire sauce, Italian seasoning, and 1 teaspoon salt into the sausage mixture. Add crushed tomatoes, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes. Add wine and cook for another 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Mix ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, basil leaves, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper together in a bowl.
        </li>
    </ol>
